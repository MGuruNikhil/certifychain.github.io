        <p class="mb-4">Welcome to CertifyChain, an open-source, decentralized certification platform built on blockchain technology. Our mission is to create a transparent, secure, and community-driven platform for issuing, verifying, and managing digital certificates.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">CertifyChain is a decentralized platform that enables organizations to issue digital certificates to individuals, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the certification process. Our platform leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof record of certifications.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">We believe that certification should be a community-driven process, free from central authority control. By decentralizing the certification process, we ensure that certificates are tamper-proof and immutable, the certification process is transparent and auditable, individuals have full control over their certifications, and organizations can issue certificates without relying on intermediaries.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Our platform uses InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to host certificates as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), decentralizing certificate storage and making it resistant to censorship and single-point failures.</p>
